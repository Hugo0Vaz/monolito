# monolito

Monolito is an experiment to use Nix as IaC.

The goal is to provide a way to define a organization infra on cloud or local using a single repo.


## Roadmap

1. Conversion of my current [nix-config](https://github.com/Hugo0Vaz/nix-config) to a [dendritic pattern](docs/Dendritic Pattern.md).
2. Define my VPS using Nix.
3. Define my local server using Nix.
4. Create a CI/CD pipeline to allow for remote host creation and management.
